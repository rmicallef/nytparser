Coaches at Jefferson raise $20, on a good day, selling coffee and doughnuts outside the school office to buy uniforms for the track and soccer teams.","label":"Education"},{"text":"Iran's Leader Relishes 2nd Chance to Make Waves Iran\u2019s president sparred with the Council on Foreign Relations, exasperating his questioners and angering the Bush administration and Jewish groups.

''Because of offensive actions against Al Qaeda since 9/11, and defense actions to improve homeland security, we believe we are safer today,'' the commission wrote in an executive summary of its long-awaited report, praising in particular the United States invasion that toppled the Taliban in Afghanistan, ending its sanctuary for Al Qaeda.

Few cities in the world offer a richer fare of movies and restaurants than Paris, yet the number of movie-goers has slumped and neighborhood bistros continue to close. The culprit? Television. The French now spend an average of three hours each day watching television -- principally between 7 P.M. and 10:30 P.M. -- compared with about four hours of daily viewing in the United States. Just as TV Guide is one of the United States' top-selling magazines, France's three top-selling magazines are voted to television. The local movie industry has particular cause for complaint because, while the French still love films, they increasingly watch them on television. In the last week of April, two of the three top-rated programs were movies. Several evenings a week, the two main channels, the privately owned TF1 and the Government-owned France 2, show movies, Canal-Plus, the pay-TV station, is largely a movie channel.

In the mid-1990's, the medical community reached an inescapable conclusion. Researchers at the Stanford University Medical School and elsewhere who had long been monitoring arthritis and rheumatism patient records had found that thousands of patients, perhaps as many as 16,500, were dying annually from bleeding ulcers and other problems caused by widely used painkillers like ibuprofen. Within a few years, a new class of pain relievers, the so-called COX-2 inhibitors, burst onto the market with the promise they might reduce that toll. Sales of the best known products, Celebrex and Vioxx, quickly skyrocketed -- thanks in part to changes in federal rules in 1997 that made it much easier for drug makers to advertise medications directly to consumers on television, in newspapers and in magazines.","label":"Health"},{"text":"Last Words at the Trade Center; Fighting to Live as the Towers Died They began as calls for help, information, guidance.

In a report scheduled for release Monday, the 14-member panel recommended 85 ways to prevent unwarranted executions, including videotaping all interrogations of suspects in capital cases, to prevent coerced confessions; reducing the number of factors making a crime eligible for the death penalty to 5 from 20; submitting all such cases to a state board for review, and establishing a statewide DNA database and an independent forensics lab.","label":"Law, Crime, and Family Issues"},{"text":"AMERICANS LACKING HEALTH INSURANCE PUT AT 16 PERCENT Despite the booming economy, the number of people without health insurance rose sharply last year, to 43.4 million, and the proportion of Americans lacking coverage reached the highest level in a decade, 16.1 percent, the Census Bureau reported to...

From the window of his small stationery supply store at the Avenue of the Americas and 18th Street in Manhattan, Michael Jacobs saw his world transformed as giant retail stores, one after another, moved into the once vacant and grimy strip of warehouses where he had operated his store since the mid-1970's. The new stores, with their employee uniforms and their emphasis on smiling, suburban-style service and vast selection, changed everything -- the buildings, the neighborhood and, in the end, Mr. Jacobs himself. He recreated his 2,800-square-foot shop in the megastores' image. He bought uniforms and name tags for his employees, and walkie-talkies so they would not have to shout to one another over customers' heads. He began accepting returns. He extended his hours, opened on Sunday for the first time, and last Christmas hired his 14-year-old son, Andrew, as doorman. Every new touch, Mr. Jacobs admits, was borrowed from the bigger players across the avenue.","label":"Banking, Finance, and Domestic Commerce"},{"text":" Inquiry Undermined, F.B.I.

Both Mr. Giuliani and Dr. Crew had argued that the bill, which would have allowed teachers to retire with a full pension at 55, would have placed an enormous burden on the system by spurring an exodus of as many as 2,500 veteran teachers after they had been assigned their classes for the school year.","label":"Education"},{"text":"Cry of Muslim Women for Equal Rights Is Rising The day Rashida was called to family court, she found herself in a scene that nearly stopped her heart.

The rush to the open spaces of suburbia that transformed the United States for the last 50 years began to slow in the 1990's, an analysis of the latest census figures shows. While some suburban outposts established themselves outside the orbit of big metropolitan areas, many older suburbs neared their physical limits of outward growth and matured into cities. The suburban landscape as it used to be known -- a collection of treehouse backyards just outside towns but never far from woods or countryside -- became increasingly scarce in the 1990's. The traditional movement outward from central cities became severely constrained by a variety of forces, like physical and geographical barriers, oppressive commuting distances and the air and water pollution caused by development.

As the pay and purchasing power of Manhattan residents have moved higher and higher, incomes in all four of the boroughs outside Manhattan have trailed inflation over the last few years, in a stark example of the increasing income disparity in New York City. In terms of wages, Manhattan families are doing better on average than those in the rest of the nation, while families in the four other boroughs are doing worse. In Manhattan, real wages -- earnings adjusted for inflation -- rose 5.4 percent between the first quarters of 2002 and 2005, led by the finance and information industries, while the national average was flat.","label":"Community Development and Housing Issues"},{"text":"$3 Million Deal In Police Killing Of Diallo in '99 Almost five years after Amadou Diallo, an unarmed immigrant from West Africa, died in a hail of 41 police bullets in the Bronx, his family agreed yesterday to a $3 million settlement of its civil lawsuit against New York City.

Almost five years after Amadou Diallo, an unarmed immigrant from West Africa, died in a hail of 41 police bullets in the Bronx, his family agreed yesterday to a $3 million settlement of its civil lawsuit against New York City.

In widespread protests, dozens of politicians and others were arrested on civil-disobedience charges, and the bullet-ridden entrance of Mr. Diallo's home became a symbol of the racial tensions renewed by the shooting.","label":"Law, Crime, and Family Issues"},{"text":"China's Middle Class Savors Its New Wealth Every Friday afternoon, dozens of late-model cars pull up to the iron gate of the three-year-old 21st-Century Experimental School, one of several new private schools here.

Hezbollah's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, celebrated Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon with a parade there six years ago. But when Israel sent in its elite Golani Infantry Brigade to secure the town before dawn on Wednesday, hundreds of soldiers were quickly pinned down by a Hezbollah ambush. Eight soldiers were killed almost immediately, and it took until early afternoon to move the dead and wounded two miles under heavy fire to a safe spot where they were picked up by helicopter and flown to a hospital in Haifa.","label":"International Affairs and Foreign Aid"},{"text":"For Israeli Unit, Hezbollah Lair Is Ambush Site The details of the battle for Bint Jbail, Lebanon, show how difficult it could be for Israel to drive Hezbollah from southern Lebanon.

The return of capital punishment has reinforced the long-held suspicion that New York is not one state but two. There is New York City and its suburbs, with the bulk of the state's murders but a fraction of its death-penalty cases. And there is the rest of the state, where prosecutors seek the death penalty far more often, and homicide defendants have been 10 times more likely to face possible execution. This striking imbalance accounts for what may be a more surprising trend. Some opponents had worried that under the new law, enacted four years ago, death sentences would fall disproportionately on minority defendants. But because most upstate counties are predominantly white, a defendant in a New York death-penalty case is far more likely to be white than black. Though whites make up only 21 percent of the state's murder defendants, they are 55 percent of the defendants in capital cases.","label":"Law, Crime, and Family Issues"},{"text":"U.S. Spy Sub Said to Record Torpedo Blast Aboard Kursk Six days after something went dreadfully wrong with the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, another submarine quietly pulled into a Norwegian port, carrying some of the most detailed evidence so far of why the pride of Russia's navy sank to the botto...

Failure to accomplish many of these objectives could delay or complicate the onset of war.","label":"Defense"},{"text":"Charity Overwhelmed in Bid To Meet Attack Victims' Bills The Salvation Army, which raised more than $60 million to help victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, came up with a simple idea for providing immediate, practical help to families affected by the disaster: It offered to pay their household bills -- any...

Hundreds of thousands of retired workers who used to have generous health benefits from large companies are digging deeper into their own pockets this year. Surging inflation in medical costs is draining hundreds of millions of dollars from corporate profits, and many large employers are responding by cutting back on health care benefits for retirees or requiring them to pay more for coverage. The reductions in health benefits stem mainly from sudden sharp increases in employer spending on prescription drugs last year. Drugs account for 40 to 60 percent of employers' overall spending on Medicare-age retirees' health care. At the same time, far-reaching cutbacks by Medicare health maintenance organizations -- which used to provide generous benefits, including drug coverage -- are forcing employers to pay for retirees' drug coverage, since traditional Medicare does not cover the cost of most drugs.","label":"Labor, Employment, and Immigration"},{"text":"Disaster Plan for Indian Point Is Called Inadequate Emergency plans are inadequate to protect the public from a disastrous leak of radiation at the Indian Point nuclear plant in Westchester County and do not fully take into account the possibility of a terrorist attack, according to a report commis...

For General Motors and Ford, this year's Detroit auto show comes at a moment of gloom. The two companies are losing market share and money in the United States, and workers' benefits are being cut. Not so for Chrysler, the only American automaker with sales that rose in 2005. On Monday, Chrysler showed off its muscle, as well as its cars, and overshadowed its hometown rivals with one of its trademark Hollywood-style productions. Its chief executive, Thomas W. LaSorda, rode in the passenger seat of the redesigned Jeep Wrangler as it burst out of a giant ivy-covered cage (a blatant rip-off of the movie ''King Kong''). The Jeep drove off the main stage, down the center aisle of the auto show and then smashed through a plate glass window at the Cobo Convention Center. There was a collective gasp from thousands of people watching the rest of its journey on a big television screen.","label":"Transportation"},{"text":"A Grand Entrance It takes a mastery of life's necessities (paying the bills) to produce the stuff of life's sustenance (theater, music, Shakespeare.)

But in private conversations, American officials are beginning to acknowledge that a judgment about when withdrawals can begin is driven by two political calendars -- one in Iraq and one here -- as much as by those military assessments. The final decision, they said, could well hinge on whether the new Iraqi government, scheduled to be elected in less than three weeks, issues its own call for an American withdrawal. Last week, for the first time, Iraq's political factions, represented by about 100 Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish leaders, collectively called for a timetable for withdrawal.","label":"Defense"},{"text":"With New York's Apples in Ruin, Growers Fear for a Way of Life Usually, when hail descends on the picturesque apple orchards of the Hudson Valley, it strikes fitfully, wreaking havoc on a farmer's field of Empires, say, but sparing his McIntoshes.

Usually, when hail descends on the picturesque apple orchards of the Hudson Valley, it strikes fitfully, wreaking havoc on a farmer's field of Empires, say, but sparing his McIntoshes. But this spring's hail was different. Two storms pelted newly formed apples with jagged balls of ice on more than 7,000 acres, and as the apples have grown, the tiny bruises have turned into ugly divots. Two thousand of those acres were so badly hurt that farmers are abandoning them entirely this season. In all, some 2.09 million bushels, about a third of the crop, are expected to be lost in what farmers say is the worst crop damage in memory.","label":"Agriculture"},{"text":"Fossil Discovery Threatens Theory of Birds' Evolution Scientists have discovered fossil evidence of the oldest known feathered animal, a small reptile that probably glided among the trees 75 million years before the earliest known bird, and they say this challenges the widely held theory that birds e... Scientists have discovered fossil evidence of the oldest known feathered animal, a small reptile that probably glided among the trees 75 million years before the earliest known bird, and they say this challenges the widely held theory that birds evolved from dinosaurs. The animal, Longisquama insignis, lived in Central Asia 220 million years ago, not long after the time of the first dinosaurs. It had four legs and what appeared to be feathers on its body. From impressions left in stone, its elongated back appendages had hollow shafts and other characteristics closely resembling those of feathers.","label":"Space, Science, Technology and Communications"},{"text":"FORD SAID TO PLAN IMPROVED MILEAGE IN SPORT UTILITIES The Ford Motor Company has decided to increase the average fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over the next five years, people involved in the company's plans said today.

The United States Navy submarine that struck and sank a Japanese fishing boat carrying 35 people on board near Hawaii on Friday was conducting a drill when it surfaced quickly, as if in an emergency, the Navy said today. In drills of this kind, the submarine's officers are supposed to use caution, first coming slowly to the surface, listening for traffic with sonar equipment and scanning the horizon for miles around through a periscope before submerging and quickly resurfacing, Navy officials in Washington and Hawaii said. Today, as the submarine docked at the Navy base at Pearl Harbor, a Navy investigation began to try to determine if these procedures were followed.","label":"Defense"},{"text":"Time-Zone Caper: Suspect Is Arrested In Testing Scheme A California man has been arrested and charged with helping students cheat on standardized exams for graduate school, using an elaborate scheme that took advantage of time- zone changes, coded pencils and expert test-takers who telephoned the answ...

The call did not go through, so the mayor dialed again. Then again. Finally, someone realized he was using an inside phone line, and pushed a button. With that, the mayor managed to complete the call, and officially launch the city's 911 line. Last year, New Yorkers dialed 911 an average of 23 times every minute, using a simple phone number now chiseled into public vocabulary, habit and expectation. Yet the 911 operation that grew since Mr. Lindsay made those first calls is less a seamless network of police, fire and ambulance services than a brittle contraption -- fragmented, uncoordinated, and in parts, dangerously obsolete and vulnerable, according to city and emergency response officials.","label":"Law, Crime, and Family Issues"},{"text":"Reading, Writing and Corporate Sponsorships School districts are following the lead of the rapid escalation of commercialism at college and professional arenas and stadiums.

On the last day of France's tense presidential campaign, polls continued to predict a landslide for the center-right president, Jacques Chirac. But it may be a hollow victory, won simply because most of the electorate objected to the extremist views of his opponent, Jean-Marie Le Pen, whose share of the vote, polls suggested, could be greater than ever before. One poll published today by the Ipsos polling institute predicted that Mr. Le Pen, who has repeatedly made racist and anti-Semitic statements, would get 18 percent to 25 percent of the vote.

Wagner Jr., the chief administrative law judge at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, essentially validates the suspicions of California officials that El Paso, the nation's largest natural gas company, withheld natural gas from the state, thus driving up the cost of electricity that was generated by gas-fired turbines.","label":"Energy"},{"text":"Tentative Accord Averts Strike By Doormen in New York City Staving off a strike in nearly 3,000 New York City apartment buildings, the union representing more than 30,000 residential building workers agreed yesterday to a tentative three-year contract that includes a lower wage for new employees and an 8....

Three months ago, a research mathematician was dismissed from his job at the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory for security violations. Today Federal authorities say it is most unlikely that the mathematician, who is at the center of the uproar over the suspected theft of nuclear secrets by China, will ever face criminal charges of espionage. Moreover, the officials are unsure whether the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, will be accused of any wrongdoing, even though investigators found in March that he had downloaded thousands of secret codes used in the design of the most sophisticated American nuclear weapons. The uncertain status of the case has infuriated some Government officials and lawmakers, primarily Republicans, who say Mr. Lee may be responsible for the most damaging espionage of the post-cold-war era. That conclusion was reinforced last month, when a Congressional panel found that China had used nuclear secrets stolen from American labs to develop advanced miniature warheads and a mobile ballistic missile.","label":"Defense"},{"text":"RUSSIAN PREMIER STEPS INTO FRAY ON JAILED TYCOON Russia's prime minister on Friday criticized the freezing of a large block of shares in the Yukos Oil Company, saying he was ''deeply concerned.''

On Capitol Hill, legislative leaders in both parties are vying to portray themselves as the better protectors of older people and other consumers against rising pharmaceutical prices, with spending on outpatient prescription drugs up 17.1 percent last year.","label":"Health"},{"text":"Under Siege, CUNY Leader Shows Coolness and Caution These are not the best of times for Dr. W.

A top Justice Department official objected in 2004 to aspects of the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program and refused to sign on to its continued use amid concerns about its legality and oversight, according to officials with knowledge of the tense internal debate. The concerns appear to have played a part in the temporary suspension of the secret program. The concerns prompted two of President Bush's most senior aides -- Andrew H. Card Jr., his chief of staff, and Alberto R. Gonzales, then White House counsel and now attorney general -- to make an emergency visit to a Washington hospital in March 2004 to discuss the program's future and try to win the needed approval from Attorney General John Ashcroft, who was hospitalized for gallbladder surgery, the officials said.","label":"Civil Rights, Minority Issues, and Civil Liberties"},{"text":"Coetzee, Writer of Apartheid As Bleak Mirror, Wins Nobel J.

Democratic leaders in the Assembly said today that they would be open to considering both proposals.","label":"Law, Crime, and Family Issues"},{"text":"U.S. Economy Grew at Brisk Pace This Winter Despite Crisis in Asia The economy grew at a surprisingly strong pace this winter, and inflation remained unexpectedly subdued, the Government reported yesterday.

The... The Government has decided to cut off disability benefits for 95,180 children, representing more than half of those whose cases have been reviewed under strict new standards established by the 1996 welfare law, Federal officials said today. The denials are running somewhat higher than the White House had expected, and if the rate continues as more cases are reviewed, 15 percent of the one million children in the program could lose their cash benefits. Data compiled by the Social Security Administration show that most of the children losing disability benefits -- 78,600 of the 95,180 -- have ''mental disorders.'' But Susan M. Daniels, the Associate Commissioner of Social Security in charge of disability programs, said she did not know how many of the children were mentally retarded, how many had personality disorders and how many had learning disabilities or behavioral problems. Members of Congress, parents and other advocates said children with major disabilities, including some with I.Q.'s in the 60's, with uncontrolled diabetes or with AIDS, had been notified that their benefits would end even though they clearly seemed to meet the new standards. The cash benefits, averaging $436 a month for a child, are paid under the Supplemental Security Income program. The children are all from low-income families. Social Security officials say the changes in the program will save $4 billion to $5 billion from 1997 to 2002. The changes in the disability program provoked fierce debate in Congress in 1995 and 1996. Republicans said that they were tightening the eligibility criteria to curtail fraud and abuse and that they had evidence that some parents were coaching children to misbehave in school or fake disabilities to get benefits. Several Democrats said the Republicans, in an effort to balance the budget, were being cruel to children. Defending the Republicans' proposal in 1995, Representative Jim McCrery of Louisiana said, ''The lethal combination of generous cash benefits, loose eligibility criteria and the lack of proper Congressional oversight inherent in all welfare entitlement programs has resulted in explosive program growth and widespread abuse.'' But Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, told the Republicans, ''You're being hard-hearted.'' He implored them to remember that ''we're talking about the most vulnerable children in America.'' Before 1996, children could qualify for benefits if they had impairments that seriously limited their ability to perform activities normal for their age. Under the new law, children can get benefits only if they have ''marked and severe functional limitations.'' Congress did not say precisely how severe the disability must be, letting the President and other officials answer that question by issuing regulations. Federal officials notified 264,000 of the one million children on the disability rolls that they might be affected by the law and that their cases would be reviewed. Those children did not have impairments that exactly matched the criteria for automatic eligibility, but had qualified for benefits through an assessment of their overall ability to function normally. Benefits have been cut off in 56 percent of the 170,300 cases reassessed so far by disability examiners. Philip A. Gambino, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration, said, ''We have done everything in our power to lessen the impact of the new law on children with disabilities.'' But critics of the cuts faulted the Clinton Administration for these reasons: *They asserted that the Government was using stricter standards than required by the 1996 law. *They said Federal officials were discouraging children and parents from challenging the termination of benefits. *They observed immense variation in the results of reviews around the country. Children are losing benefits in more than 75 percent of all cases reviewed in Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana and Texas. But the comparable figures are less than 35 percent in Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota and Nevada. Ms. Daniels rejected the criticism, saying, ''We monitor the quality of decisions. We have no indication that they are inaccurate.'' President Clinton, who signed the welfare bill on Aug. 22, 1996, recently persuaded Congress to soften some provisions, including restrictions on benefits for legal immigrants. But he did not resist the new standards for children's disability benefits. Kenneth S. Apfel, associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, supervised preparation of the rules setting stricter standards. In May, Mr. Clinton nominated him to be Commissioner of Social Security. Senators of both parties said they would question Mr. Apfel about the disability program at his confirmation hearing. In a recent letter to the President, Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, a Republican, and Kent Conrad of North Dakota, a Democrat, said the eligibility criteria being used to evaluate children's disabilities were ''far more severe than is required'' by the 1996 welfare law. They asserted that ''the Administration has misinterpreted the intent of Congress in reforming the Supplemental Security Income program for children.'' Jonathan M. Stein, general counsel of Community Legal Services in Philadelphia, who has represented scores of disabled children, said, ''Congress set a somewhat stricter standard, but the Administration has misinterpreted it and applied it in an arbitrary, anarchic way, with extraordinary variation among states.'' Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a longtime advocate for people with mental disabilities, is lobbying Congress and the White House to revise the rules, which she said were ''unfair to children with mental retardation.'' The Federal benefit payments are used to pay for treatment and social services, to make structural changes in houses and offset wages lost by parents who stay home to care for disabled children. Administration officials said savings to the Federal Treasury would fall far short of projections if the disability rules were as lenient as opponents of the cuts have proposed. Most of the decisions to terminate disability benefits were made by state officials who work under contract with the Federal Government, using Federal standards. They do not see or interview the children getting benefits. Parents may ask the Government to continue paying benefits while they appeal. But Thelma L. Jackson, the great-aunt and guardian of a boy in Philadelphia who is losing his disability benefits, said Social Security employees had discouraged her from exercising this right. She quoted a claims representative as saying: ''You will have to pay it back. The Government will hound you until you pay it back.'' Teri M. Toothman of Wheeling, W. Va., who was told in June that her two sons were losing disability benefits, said that Social Security employees made had clear that ''they didn't want us to appeal'' and that they might sue her to recover any overpayments. Nancy Goodwin, a paralegal who has worked on disability cases for 15 years at Acadiana Legal Service Corporation, a legal aid program in Lafayette, La., said: ''Children are not being evaluated fairly, not in this state. Almost as soon as parents submit information requested by the Social Security Administration, they get back letters saying their children are no longer disabled.''","label":"Social Welfare"},{"text":"Rising Costs Result in a Proposal To Delay 6 New Queens Schools Board of Education staff members have proposed delaying the construction of six new schools in Queens and postponing most major school renovations in the five boroughs for two or more years because of soaring construction costs, according to board...

Despite Congressional refusal for almost a decade to raise the federal minimum wage, nearly half of the civilian labor force lives in states where the pay is higher than the rate set by the federal government. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have acted on their own to set minimum wages that exceed the $5.15 an hour rate set by the federal government, and this year lawmakers in dozens of the remaining states will debate raising the minimum wage. Some states that already have a higher minimum wage than the federal rate will be debating further increases and adjustments for inflation.","label":"Labor, Employment, and Immigration"},{"text":"Inquiry Turns To Chemicals In Jet's Cargo The Valujet DC-9 that crashed in the Everglades on Saturday was carrying as cargo in its forward hold 50 or 60 bottles of chemicals used to make oxygen for  emergency masks, the National Transportation Safety Board said tonight, raising  the possi... The Valujet DC-9 that crashed in the Everglades on Saturday was carrying as cargo in its forward hold 50 or 60 bottles of chemicals used to make oxygen for emergency masks, the National Transportation Safety Board said tonight, raising the possibility that they caused a fire or explosion. When the bottles make oxygen, by mixing two chemicals, the reaction also produces heat. The board also said that the flight-data recorder, recovered on Monday and deciphered overnight by its technicians, recorded the plane's instruments as indicating a very sudden drop in altitude and speed, while the plane did not actually slow or drop. Experts said the instruments could have been thrown off in that fashion by an explosion inside the plane.","label":"Transportation"},{"text":"Staten Island Phone Let U.S. Eavesdrop On Global Militants Evidence in the case of Lynne F.

The White House said it would try to head off corporate lobbyists -- many representing major contributors to the Bush campaign -- who seek to garnish it with huge cuts for their wealthy clients.","label":"Macroeconomics"},{"text":"Albania Chief's Associates Flee; Gunfire Halts Evacuation by U.S. The collapse of authority in Albania worsened today, as close confidants of the President fled the country and the Government failed in its effort to seize weapons from roving bands of thugs.

With the deadline for agreement on a peace plan wisely extended until tomorrow, both parties seemed to slip farther away from signing a deal, and there is new division in the six-nation Contact Group running the talks. The best chance for peace lies with keeping the Contact Group focused on its original demands and its threat to bomb Serbian military targets if the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, remains defiant. The ethnic Albanians have been serious and cooperative negotiators, and last week seemed ready to sign the deal. But yesterday, in what may be a temporary bargaining gambit, they insisted that the plan's possibilities for an independent Kosovo were insufficient, and called for a referendum on the issue in three years. At last word yesterday, the Albanians had not withdrawn the demand. They should do so quickly.

NEWMAN, a professor of cell biology and anatomy at New York Medical College, wanted to do something controversial to evoke public and scientific debate on the morality of genetic engineering. So Dr. Newman and a colleague filed a patent for a process to make ''chimeras,'' creatures that are part human, part animal. A resident of Pleasantville, Dr. Newman and his colleague, Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends in Washington, do not want to make the creatures. In fact, Dr. Newman does not think anyone should be allowed to make them and thinks these kinds of patents should be rejected. But he wants people to talk more about the issues so laws and ethics can be established before science delivers a done deal.","label":"Foreign Trade"},{"text":"DRAWING A LINE  ","label":"Foreign Trade"},{"text":"DRAWING A LINE SATJIV CHAHIL stopped traveling with a laptop computer because he didn't want to be part of the teeming masses he sees in airports carrying black cases with Dell on the side.

As a Baptist minister, the Rev. Luis Cortes has long sought to build a national network of Hispanic churches, one that would bring new power to an emerging minority. As an elected official, President Bush has long sought a more diverse Republican Party, one that would lure more blacks and Hispanics to a dominant conservative bloc. These days, the two are united by faith, friendship, and a line item in the federal budget called the Compassion Capital Fund. A religion-based fusion of politics and policy, the fund is the president's most tangible effort to help those he calls the ''armies of compassion,'' small religious groups with shoestring budgets that care for the downtrodden. Over the last three years, it has spent $100 million to train such religiously motivated foot soldiers, and in some cases to give them small grants, on the theory that a bit of managerial coaching will mobilize new healing platoons.","label":"Social Welfare"},{"text":"War Games on the Korean Peninsula Photo of American soldiers taking part in regularly scheduled military exercise in Paju, South Korea, near demilitarized zone between North and South Korea ","label":"Defense"},{"text":"Tighter Gas Supply Is Expected to Send Prices Even Higher Anyone who has not been shocked by the rapid climb in retail gasoline prices, to record levels in some cities, may want to prepare for what is to come.

During a series of heated meetings, several Republican Senators from the city and its suburbs told Mr. Bruno, a Republican of Rensselaer County, that they would suffer severe political damage if forced to vote on his bill, even if they voted against it. Senators from the region are under such pressure that Mr. Bruno's majority may dwindle to a one-vote margin, a sign of weakness.","label":"Community Development and Housing Issues"},{"text":"Bishops Proceed Cautiously In Carrying Out Abuse Policy Two months after America's Roman Catholic bishops adopted broad new policies to defuse a sexual abuse crisis, 31 bishops say they have moved swiftly to remove or suspend 114 priests, throwing dozens of parishes into turmoil, according to a survey ... Two months after America's Roman Catholic bishops adopted broad new policies to defuse a sexual abuse crisis, 31 bishops say they have moved swiftly to remove or suspend 114 priests, throwing dozens of parishes into turmoil, according to a survey of the nation's dioceses by The New York Times.

The latest interruptions in oil supplies are likely to send retail gasoline prices even higher than the current average of $2.60 a gallon. They have prompted the Bush administration to say it would release emergency oil stocks from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed.","label":"Energy"},{"text":"U.S. Trade Deficit Climbs to New High The nation's monthly trade deficit reached a new high of $13 billion in March, the Government reported, providing the clearest evidence yet  how Asia's mounting economic woes are restraining American growth for good and for ill.

An obscure change in immigration law passed in the waning days of the Clinton administration could lead to legal status for as many as half-a-million illegal immigrants, but it could also lead to disappointment for millions more who have misinterpreted the change as a general amnesty. The crucial part of the law temporarily reinstates a provision, in effect from 1994 to 1998, that allows illegal immigrants with certain family relationships or with the backing of some employers to petition for legal status without having to go to the American consulate in their home countries. That is significant because most illegal immigrants are prohibited re-entry -- for anywhere from 3 to 10 years -- if they leave the country, dissuading those who might otherwise legalize their status.","label":"Quality of Life"},{"text":"Philanthropy Google's Way: Not the Usual Unlike most charities, Google\u2019s new philanthropy will be for-profit, a move that could greatly increase its range and flexibility.

Eight days before Hitler annexed Austria in March 1938, at a time when much of the world shrugged at the approach of Nazism, two prominent Jewish families in Vienna raced to a Swiss bank. Coolly realistic about the troubles facing them and determined to preserve their ownership of one of the country's largest sugar refineries, they set up a trust account to protect their ownership. The attempt quickly unraveled. Within months the bank had violated the terms of the account, and the business was ''aryanized'' -- sold for a fraction of its value to a Nazi sympathizer. In a letter dated Dec. 22, 1938, a bank officer provided an explanation as blunt as it was chilling: ''The situation has changed.''","label":"Defense"},{"text":"Captives' 52 Hours of Horror: Heat, Hunger, and Then Death Survivors and their families have begun to give an account of the 52 hours of killings and captivity at the hands of gunmen.

Byrd and his pilot-mechanic, Floyd Bennett, won fame as the first to fly an airplane to the North Pole. Or so they claimed. Doubts that they reached the pole have persisted to this day, and a few skeptics have suspected that they never even made a serious attempt. Now archivists at Ohio State University have found the diary Byrd kept on the flight. After a meticulous examination of the diary's contents, including some erasures at critical points, a specialist in navigation and science history has concluded that Lieutenant Commander (later Rear Admiral) Byrd almost certainly fell short of his polar destination and must have known at the time that he had not succeeded.

Any movie set in Las Vegas ought, if nothing else, to celebrate the city's transcendent gaudiness.

Editorial page editors live perpetually under the cloud of knowing they can never point out, warn about and comment on all the things that deserve attention. This page will never touch all the bases, but there are a few rules we try to honor. One is that while The New York Times has become a truly national paper, it is still also very much a local paper to its home city and the surrounding suburbs. To serve both those roles, The Times has begun to print different editorial pages in its national and metropolitan editions on some occasions. Today, for instance, readers in the New York metropolitan area will see an editorial about the need for reform of the lobbying laws in Albany in the place where national readers have an editorial on policies toward the homeless. Both pieces can be read on the Times Web site, and both will be included in the paper's permanent databank under today's date.","label":"Space, Science, Technology and Communications"},{"text":"To Our Readers Starting on Monday, the suggested newsstand price of The Times on weekdays will increase to 75 cents in the greater New York metropolitan area.

Repeatedly calling the judge sir, Mr. Rader methodically described trolling neighborhoods in search of prey, plucking names from mailboxes and stalking women to work, but he said he also picked at least one target at random.","label":"Law, Crime, and Family Issues"},{"text":"Citadel's President Insists Coeducation Will Succeed A day after two of four women withdrew as cadets from the Citadel, saying they had been harassed and hazed, the head of the college expressed his determination to make coeducation work.

The Federal appeals court ruling could further slow the introduction of unbridled competition -- and the lower prices expected to result from that competition -- in the nation's telecommunications business, because it would allow states to develop different mechanisms for bringing new companies into the market rather than following uniform F.C.C. guidelines.","label":"Space, Science, Technology and Communications"},{"text":"As Factory Jobs Disappear, Ohio Town Has Few Options For nearly 30 years, Jim Greathouse was part of the blue-collar elite, a tool-and-die man who sometimes earned more than $50,000 a year because his job, making the precision metal molds that factories use to shape parts, required such exacting ski...

The long, brutal process that leads to Alzheimer's disease starts when a single enzyme snips a protein that protrudes from brain cells, leading to the release of toxic shards. Now scientists report that they have found that enzyme, opening the door to developing drugs that might block it and, if the drugs prove safe, to preventing or slowing the disease. The discovery of the enzyme had eluded teams of scientists at universities and drug companies for more than a decade, though they had given it a name, beta-secretase. So many false claims of victory were announced that investigators automatically doubted anyone who claimed to have found it.","label":"Health"},{"text":"Scientists Find Enzyme Linked To Alzheimer's Scientists have known for years that to forestall or treat Alzheimer's disease they needed to prevent hard balls of debris from accumulating in the brain.

Scientists have known for years that to forestall or treat Alzheimer's disease they needed to prevent hard balls of debris from accumulating in the brain. Now researchers at Amgen have taken the first step toward that goal. They found an elusive enzyme that snips a brain protein in two, initiating the formation of the debris. The next challenge, experts say, is to find a drug that will block that enzyme.

Echoing President Bush's public comments, the Chinese said in a briefing on Tuesday that they still hoped that talks with North Korea would succeed in disarming the country, even though it has boycotted those talks for 11 months.","label":"International Affairs and Foreign Aid"},{"text":"GUIDELINES BY U.S. URGE MAMMOGRAMS FOR WOMEN AT 40 After months of controversy over whether mammograms save lives, federal health officials today issued new guidelines for breast cancer screening that strongly recommend the tests and lower the age at which women should begin receiving them to 40 f...

It took until mid-March nearly four months after the first outbreak -- for the world to learn of SARS. Yet a look back at the early days of the epidemic, and at the earliest warnings given to the World Health Organization, leaves little doubt that the agency acted as swiftly as it could. Some opportunities were missed along the way, and the health agency was led astray by assumptions that later proved wrong.

And from the start, they were frustrated by the lack of official candor in China, where severe acute respiratory syndrome first erupted last November.","label":"Health"},{"text":"Drug Costs Run Free Under New York Medicaid Lacking the most basic controls, New York frequently pays many times more for drugs than Medicaid programs in other states. Penlac Nail Lacquer rarely cures the nail fungus it is designed to treat, yet it costs $130 a thimbleful. As a result, more than 20 state Medicaid programs and dozens of private health insurers require doctors to get advance permission to prescribe it. But not New York Medicaid, which spent $12 million on the drug last year, more than eight times as much as any other state. New York spent $74 million last year, far more than any other state, on Nexium, the ''new Purple Pill'' for heartburn. The drug is virtually identical to Prilosec, available at one-sixth the cost over the counter, and so at least 20 state Medicaid programs and many private health insurance companies severely restrict its use. Only now, two years after other states began imposing limits on Nexium, has New York moved to restrict it.","label":"Health"},{"text":"What 2 G.I.'s Shared If the two soldiers had one thing in common, it was a determination to fight in Iraq, seeing it as the right thing, their families said.

Candid discussions about race are difficult even in intimate settings among well-acquainted people. For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day. For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, affirmative action and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of affirmative action, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of affirmative action the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.","label":"Civil Rights, Minority Issues, and Civil Liberties"},{"text":"TALKING ABOUT RACE Your issue on racism in America looks like something ordered under Stalin: propaganda that had to be done.

Who could fault the outpouring of virtue from President Clinton's town hall on race last week? It was a lesson in gentility for afternoon television, a show without raunch or rant, insults or inanities, crackpotism or kookery. One wanted to like it. But when it comes to race, television has moved much beyond the sound bites that filled those two hours of C-Span. One can imagine a time when television, if there had been television, would have been important for this sort of display, say if in the 1930's a national figure like Eleanor Roosevelt had led an all-American tolerance class. That could have improved benighted attitudes toward minorities. But with the help of television itself, the nation is, happily, well beyond such pleas and admonitions.","label":"Civil Rights, Minority Issues, and Civil Liberties"},{"text":"TALKING ABOUT RACE The Times's six-week report ''How Race Is Lived in America'' concludes with a special issue of The Times Magazine, presenting first-person observations on race from a variety of public figures and private citizens.

By Friday, half the 50 states had submitted plans to the Federal Department of Health and Human Services showing how they intended to use the new block grants that replace the old welfare programs abolished by the law. Two of those plans, Wisconsin's and Michigan's, have been approved; the rest are pending.","label":"Social Welfare"},{"text":"Scientists Report They Have Made Robot That Makes Its Own Robots For the first time, computer scientists have created a robot that designs and builds other robots, almost entirely without human help.

In what colleagues hailed as a historic landmark, 120 physicists from 23 research institutions in Japan and the United States announced today that they had found the existence of mass in a notoriously elusive subatomic particle called the neutrino. The neutrino, a particle that carries no electric charge, is so light that it was assumed for many years to have no mass at all. After today's announcement, cosmologists will have to confront the possibility that a significant part of the mass of the universe might be in the form of neutrinos. The discovery will also compel scientists to revise a highly successful theory of the composition of matter, the Standard Model.","label":"Space, Science, Technology and Communications"},{"text":"New Fees to Use Pay Phones Adding Up to $1 Billion Bill For decades Americans have assumed, correctly, that they could call ''800'' telephone numbers free, any time and from any phone.

For decades Americans have assumed, correctly, that they could call ''800'' telephone numbers free, any time and from any phone.

For the first time since AIDS began killing Ugandans in the early 1980's, there are strong signs that its spread has slowed markedly among young adults and that a new generation is less likely to become infected with the deadly virus because it has adopted safer sexual practices.

The decision -- the centerpiece of a binding national policy intended to deal with the devastating sexual abuse crisis in the church -- means that any priest known to have ever abused a child, no matter how long ago, may no longer serve as a pastor or chaplain in a parish, school, hospital or nursing home. He may retain the title of priest, but he will no longer be allowed to dress in clerical garb or to say Mass anywhere but in private.

Over the break, Rep... As Congress returns this week from its August recess, Republicans and the White House face the difficult choice of compromise or confrontation on issues including tax cuts, gun control and regulation of managed health care. Over the break, Republicans also promised to begin a series of contentious and potentially embarrassing hearings for the Administration into accusations that Russians laundered billions of dollars through the Bank of New York, and into new revelations about the siege at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., in 1993. The first big step, however, will be President Clinton's. He is eager for Republicans to send him their $792 billion tax cut bill so he can veto it on the ground that it is too expensive. After that, the battle will begin over the fall's dominant issue: how to divide the projected $3 trillion Federal surplus among tax relief, Federal programs and debt reduction through the next decade. Republicans had counted on whipping up support for their tax bill in town meetings and other events across the country in August. But the campaign apparently failed to stir constituents from their summer diversions or shift the White House's strategy. Armed with polling data and past experience, the White House is confident that the public is on its side on the issue of taxes and spending. Mr. Clinton said in his radio address on Saturday that he would support a smaller tax package in return for Republican concessions on Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, including a voluntary prescription drug program for senior citizens. ''We think there may be the basis for looking at a middle-class tax cut at a level we can pay for, once we've done the important things on Social Security and Medicare,'' the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said on Sunday. Mr. Lockhart said $300 billion was the maximum tax relief the President was willing to accept. Congressional Republicans are divided over whether to adopt a conciliatory approach and produce some legislative gains, or stick to their core principles going into the 2000 campaign season. Aides say Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and some crucial Senate Republicans, like Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee, are willing to discuss a smaller tax package. But Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, are counseling a hard line, Republican aides say. Many Congressional Republicans also express suspicions that the President may be less interested in a grand bargain than in a legislative train wreck that he and Vice President Al Gore could use as a campaign issue. ''This latest exercise is further proof that the President does not want to admit that he is dead set against giving any tax relief to married couples, small-business owners, investors and millions of other Americans,'' said Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee. Meanwhile, the greater worry both inside the White House and among some Democrats on Capitol Hill, one White House official said, is that the President, in his eagerness to strike a deal, will compromise both his and his party's principles. Aides are working to make sure he does not reach an agreement that robs Democratsof a potent campaign issue or that forces them to choose between their President and their constituents. In addition to sorting out the nation's fiscal priorities into the new millennium, Congress must pass 13 appropriations bills to keep the Government running after Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year. The House has approved 11, the Senate 9. Only two are ready to be sent to the President. The House and Senate, convening on Wednesday in what will be a light first week back to work, each resumes work on spending bills as the first order of business. Congressional appropriators have tried to devise a budget under strict spending limits outlined in the 1997 balanced-budget agreement, but they now concede it is likely that Congress will have to borrow from Social Security to pay for Government operations next year. Each party will probably blame the other if this happens. Adding to the pressure on the budget caps, President Clinton later this month will request from lawmakers several billion dollars in additional spending for fiscal 2000, including new money for drought relief, aid to earthquake victims in Turkey and peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts in Kosovo. Democrats have a long list of non-budgetary priorities whose fate remains in limbo, including gun control, managed-care regulation and an overhaul of the campaign finance system. House and Senate negotiators are to meet this month to try to reconcile juvenile-justice bills. The Senate version tightens gun control; the House bill is silent on the matter. The Senate has approved a managed-care bill; the House will probably debate and vote on at least one version this month. The House is set to debate campaign finance next week; the Senate most likely will do so next month. Republicans leaders see little political gain in any of these three divisive issues, and are likely to try to thwart all but the most minimal changes. Congressional Democrats and White House aides acknowledge that prospects are slim for any major policy achievements next year, Mr. Clinton's last in office. So Democrats have a narrow window to broker any compromises this year before the Presidential campaign season seizes all the political attention. Yet the White House has signaled that it does not need Republican cooperation to notch policy successes. ''If the Republicans come back and they're not interested, and they want gridlock, well, we're going to keep moving forward,'' Mr. Lockhart said. The Administration is considering executive actions on initiatives like clean-air regulations and promoting parental leave. With such an ambitious fall agenda, few lawmakers or aides are sanguine that the House, at least, will meet the Oct. 29 adjournment date tentatively scheduled by Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader. Indeed, John J. Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who follows Congress closely, summed up his forecast for the fall legislative season in one word: ''Pain.''","label":"Macroeconomics"},{"text":"SOVEREIGN ISLANDS: A special report.; A Texas woman on a Caribbean cruise with her husband accused a waiter of drugging their dinner drinks and later raping her in their cabin.

For laboring as long as 18 hours a day, seven days a week, most galley workers are paid $400 to $450 a month. These are the migrant workers of the oceans, the thousands of dishwashers, assistant cooks, cabin cleaners and brass-rail polishers who toil unnoticed and unheard aboard luxury cruise ships.

When he signed it into law, President Bush hailed the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 as ''the greatest advance in health care coverage for America's seniors since the founding of Medicare.'' The overhaul of the program, including the addition of prescription drug benefits, was seen as his biggest accomplishment in domestic policy and a major asset to his re-election campaign. But over the last 10 months, the Bush administration's efforts to carry out the first phase of that law, providing drug discount cards to the elderly, have been plagued with difficulties. Many health policy experts say that even greater problems loom as the government turns to the more ambitious task of providing a full-fledged drug benefit to 41 million elderly and disabled people in 2006.","label":"Health"},{"text":"Study Sets Off Debate Over Mammograms' Value A new study in a British medical journal has stirred a passionate debate among doctors in Europe and the United States by asserting that mammograms do not prevent women from dying of breast cancer or help them avoid mastectomies.

The computer malfunction was so bad in August that United States intelligence agencies were left nearly blind for a few days, unable to rely on photographs from any spy satellites for use in a wide range of intelligence operations, officials added.","label":"Defense"},{"text":"A Push From the Top Shatters a Glass Ceiling Hewlett-Packard's elevation of Carly Fiorina to the post of chief executive last month solidified the company's reputation as a bastion of egalitarianism in a male-dominated corporate world.

Hewlett-Packard's elevation of Carly Fiorina to the post of chief executive last month solidified the company's reputation as a bastion of egalitarianism in a male-dominated corporate world. With more than a quarter of Hewlett-Packard's managers women -- including one who was a main rival of Ms. Fiorina for the top job -- it seemed incontestable that the glass ceiling that stops the rise of female executives at so many other companies had been shattered.

Officials of the National Transportation Safety Board are not close to declaring that the loss of the fin, a 27-foot-high structure that is essential to flight, was the cause of the crash, or even the first part to leave the jetliner, an Airbus A300, in its puzzling in-flight breakup.","label":"Transportation"},{"text":"Tears for Flight 800 Colleagues Photo of memorial rite at Kennedy International Airport, New York City, for Trans World Airlines employees who died year ago in explosion of Flight 800; monument to victims is unveiled ","label":"Transportation"},{"text":"Bush Backs Troop Plan President Bush is set to announce that he backs a Pentagon redeployment plan and will withdraw troops from Europe and Asia.

The move by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, which holds 10.4 percent of Hewlett-Packard's shares, unites the heirs of William Hewlett and David Packard, who founded their company in 1938 in a garage in Palo Alto, Calif., and the family foundations against the $24 billion deal.

Children and adolescents, who were once routinely left out of pharmaceutical research, are now being enrolled by the thousands into drug company experiments, a trend that is both transforming the care of sick children and generating qualms among pediatricians, ethicists and parents. The federal government is the driving force behind the change. In 1997, Congress offered pharmaceutical manufacturers lucrative incentives to study their products in children. And in December, the Food and Drug Administration began requiring companies to test almost all new medicines in young people.","label":"Health"},{"text":"Rebels Kill Egyptian Diplomat, Adding Pressure on Others in Iraq The killing was the most serious blow yet by groups seeking to intimidate Arab countries that have been moving toward fuller ties with Iraq. The insurgent group Al Qaeda in Iraq said Thursday that it had killed Egypt's ambassador-designate in Iraq, Ihab al-Sharif, four days after gunmen seized him on a street in a diplomatic quarter in western Baghdad, where he had driven alone to buy a local newspaper. In a posting on an Islamic Web site, the group said Mr. Sharif's killing was ''the judgment of God'' and described him as representing a ''tyrannical'' government in Egypt that was allied with ''Jews and Christians.'' An accompanying video showed Mr. Sharif, 51, saying he had been Egypt's deputy ambassador in Israel before relations were downgraded after the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation that began five years ago.","label":"Defense"},{"text":"Next in Line in Argentina Photo of inauguration of Eduardo Duhalde as Argentina's fifth president in two weeks ","label":"International Affairs and Foreign Aid"},{"text":"Importing Less Expensive Drugs Not Seen as Cure for U.S. Woes Experts say that importing drugs from countries that control their prices would not make drugs cheaper in the U.S. A customer at the Concourse Drugs pharmacy in the Bronx will pay about $118 for a month's supply of 20-milligram Lipitor. At PharmacyinCanada.com, a Canadian online outlet, the same quantity of the drug, Pfizer's cholesterol-lowering medication, costs $79. The difference has become a tempting political target. Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate, has made a campaign pledge to help cut Americans' prescription drug costs by allowing them to import drugs from Canada. President Bush has conceded that the idea is worth a try ''if there's a safe way to do it.'' Bipartisan legislation in Congress would allow the reimportation of prescription drugs from Canada and other industrialized countries.","label":"Health"},{"text":"Harsh Report on Day Care Death Finds Dangerous Flaws in System New York's Health Department called its oversight of day care centers a bureaucratic maze riddled with problems that spell potential dangers for children.

In an extraordinary self-examination, the department said its Bureau of Day Care needed reforms to expand its staff, raise training standards, tighten inspections and improve communications among its own people as well as with day care operators, parents often left in the dark about violations, and an array of city and state agencies trying to enforce a bewildering labyrinth of regulations.","label":"Labor, Employment, and Immigration"},{"text":" Overnight, a Towering Divide Rises in Jerusalem With a towering concrete slab lowered almost tenderly into a ragged street, Israel began drawing a hard line around Jerusalem on Sunday, walling it off from Abu Dis, an Arab village joined to the city for generations.
